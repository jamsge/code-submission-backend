hi there :) u get started like this
1. `cd` into project directory
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to start development server on port 3000

The server now runs at http://localhost:3000

yay!


# Notes
It's helpful to get a API testing client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Let jams know if you have any question or need help :D

(todo: write a better readme)
