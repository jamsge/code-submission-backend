# code-submission-backend

The `api` directory contains code for the codenao REST API. Use `docker build` to build, and `docker run -p {insert port here}:3000 -d <your username>/node-web-app` to run at a specified port.

# Notes

It's helpful to get a API testing client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Let jams know if you have any question or need help :D

(todo: write a better readme)
